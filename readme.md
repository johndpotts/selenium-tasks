# Selenium Tasks

This is a quick-start repo for anyone wanting to play around with selenium webdriver in node. It gives you four files to start with: login.js, get-console-logs.js, take-screenshot.js, and submit-form.js.

Using it is simple - clone the repo to your machine, cd into it, and run `npm install`. 

That will download the necessary dependencies. To test drive the files, just choose one and run it with node from the terminal: `node login.js`.

These files are meant to give you a starting point for using selenium. You can find all the api documentation at [seleniumhq.github.io](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).

Have fun!
